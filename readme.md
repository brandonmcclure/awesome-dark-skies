A curated list of [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md) tools to increase dark skies. This repo currently reflects my limited perspective, and is therefore north america, and english focused. I would love for your issues and pull requests about how we can make this a more awesome resource for all!

## Maps/public data

Here you will find public tools for viewing data so that you can create better narratives about your own dark skies. I prefer open source tools, but useability is also very important!

## Sky quality assessments

How can you improve what you cannot measure? We need consistent data to support regulatory changes in order to effectively drive change.

## (Citizen?) Science

I do not have any items for this section due to my current ignorance of this topic in general. I would like to add resources to this section that makes it easier for scientists to collaborate with each other and with citizens in general. Are you doing science in this area and want to share? I want to hear about it!
